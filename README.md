Maze Game

Decription: Uses a Prim's simplified algorithm to generate a Maze that is guaranteed to have a solution. 

Prims Simplified Algorithm: 
    -- When researching Prim's Simplified Algorithm for Maze Generationg, I used a combination of wikipedia and this Ian Howell Maze generation example to understand the logic behind the Prim's Algorthim 
        -- https://github.com/ian-howell/Mazes
        
Essentially, Prims randomly selects a square from a 2D Array. 

Then, by checking in all 4 directions, makes sure that only one of the 4 directions is blocked.
